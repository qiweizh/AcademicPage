# 3D Tenary phase diagram

Understanding and interpreting phase equilibrium diagrams is an essential skill for geological major students who intend to unravel the partial melting process of mantle or the differentiation of primitive magma. Phase diagrams show how phases or phase assemblages change as a function of temperature, pressure, phase composition, or combinations of these variables. It provides fundamental information on the equilibrium relations among different elements and compounds. 
While single phase diagrams and binary phase diagrams are very useful to explain the crystallization sequence and the composition variation path of liquid and minerals, the most common igneous system in natural environment are composed of multi-components.   

Understanding and interpreting these diagrams significantly relies on strong visualization skills to imagine the three dimensional (3D) shape of liquidus and solidus surfaces and their boundaries, which might be fairly complex for beginners who lack of such ability. 
Hopefully, computer-aided design software offers a new, more interactive method for presenting 3D information. Here, I would share my own understanding of how to compose a 3D ternary phase diagram from scratch. I developed a series of computer-based modules to help students visualize the different phase volumes within a 3D ternary phase diagram. 

So, Letâ€™s roll.
