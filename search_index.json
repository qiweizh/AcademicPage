Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\n\nWelcome to my personal academic site！ My name is Qiwei Zhang, a master student in China University of Geosciences (Beijing). My primary research orientation is quantitative petrology. I prefer to use multidisciplinary approach including geochemistry, igneous petrology, thermodynamic modeling, and field work to investigate the fundamental chemical and physical processes that control magma evolution at depth as well as shallow plumbing systems underlying active volcanoes. \nI will use this site to post my recent research about ternary phase diagram, the fractionation process of high silica granite and some computer programs I made. Here is my Curriculum Vitae. If any questions come up, please don't hesitate to contact me through my email:qiwei.zh@foxmail.com.\n\n"},"Research.html":{"url":"Research.html","title":"2 Research","keywords":"","body":"Potential Interest Research\n\nMagma chamber dynamics, partial melting of mantle, evolution of volcanoes by means of experimental petrology and thermodynamic modeling.\nTransition of igneous and hydrothermal processes through the analysis of melt and fluid inclusions.\n\nWhat I have done?\n\nPetrogenesis of high-silica granite. I found two groups of zircon in high silica granite with distinct geochemical compositions and then developed a zircon REE reserve program by MATLAB® (Section 2.3.1) to quantitatively calculation the percentage of co-precipitating minerals. The calculation shows a two-stage in-situ fractionation process during the formation of high silica granite. This result has been published in Chemical Geology.\n\nTin deposits are closely associated with high-silica granite. I have collected a series of granite samples with different fractionation phase as well as tin-rich ore samples. The preliminary study suggests only slight enrichment of tin after magmatic fractionation. And the fluid inclusion study shows that the sanity of fluid increases with decreasing temperature, indicating a boiling event of hydrothermal fluid, which might be the main reason for the tin enrichment. \n\nThe study of experimental geology requires students with a solid foundation in phase equilibria. I have finished reading the book ‘Petrologic Phase Equilibria’ by W.G. Ernst and read many phase diagram tutorial materials on the website. During the study, I found very difficult in understanding the ternary phase diagram due to my poor visualization skill. In order to improve that, I learned the 3D software 3D max® and AutoCAD® by myself and built 3D ternary models for the ternary eutectic system and An-Ab-Or system (Section 2.2).\n\nGeochemical researches often require great amount of work comparing data to those in literature. It is necessary and significant to find a quick way to create figures to show their geochemical variation. Because most scholars use Microsoft Excel to process data, I design  two VBA® programs (SortData and QuickPlot) (Section 2.3.2) which incorporates the most common geochemical discrimination figures, trace element spider diagrams, Haker diagrams and etc.\n\n\nWhat I am planning to do:\n\nAccumulate lab experience in experimental petrology.\nSince the METLS is open source on GitLab®, I have forked the program and tried to understand the code and update it if possible.\nMeasure the composition of melt and fluid inclusions in my sample and wish to unravel the transition of igneous and hydrothermal processes.\n\n"},"High silica granite.html":{"url":"High silica granite.html","title":"2.1 Fractionation of high silica granite","keywords":"","body":"Fractionation of high silica granite\nHigh-silica granite (SiO2 > 70 wt%) commonly locates at the top of magmatic pluton. Understanding the formation of high-silica granite is important because it is an important carrier of incompatible elements and commonly associated with rhyolite eruption. A large number of scholars believed that most high-silica granites were extracted from an intermediate magma chamber into the shallow crust via the liquid-crystal segregation process (as shown in Fig. 1 Bachmann and Bergantz, 2004). However, whether high-silica melt could undergo significant fractionation after the segregation remains unclear. \n\nFig. 1 Schematic illustration of the melt expulsion model for the generation of crystal-poor rhyolites from Bachmann and Bergantz (2004)\nA few scholars considered high-silica melt is difficult to further fractionate due to its high viscosity (Pitcher, 1997; Petford, 2003; Glazner, 2014). And some scholars believe that the extreme fractionation of feldspar and biotite could lead to unrealistic high SiO2 content. On the contrary, others argued that dissolved water in high-silica melts reduces the viscosity and makes significant fractionation possible (Lee et al., 2015). Moreover, crystallization process of high silica melt does not follow traditional Rayleigh fractionation formula but in-situ fractionation model (Langmuir, 1989, Fig. 2). Thus, the quartz could be segregated from the melt and reduce the SiO2 content.\n\nFig. 2 Schematic diagram of in situ crystallization\nIn our study, we contribute to this topic through the lens of zircon trace element variation. Zircon is a robust proxy for magma fractionation (Claiborne et al., 2010). Considering the fact of that REE in zircon are significantly influenced by different co-precipitating minerals, the types and amounts of the co-precipitating minerals can be calculated via the fractionation principle in terms of REE variation of zircon (Hoskin et al., 2000; Loader et al., 2017).\nThe zircons crystallized from our granite samples can be divided into two groups. The group 1 zircons are characterized by lower Hf ( 12,200 ppm), and display elevated U values (936–2429 ppm, averaging 1557 ppm) and Yb values (755–1556 ppm, averaging 1134 ppm), as well as lower EuN/Eu^N (0.01–0.1) (Fig. 3). \n\nFig. 3 Two types of zircon with different geochemical composition\nThe presence of these two groups of zircons is considered to reflect two-stage in-situ fractionation processes, which display distinct REE (rare earth elements) compositions in the magma system in response to differing precipitated mineral assemblages. In light of the change of zircon REE within each group, I developed a zircon REE reserve program by MATLAB®. The percentage of minerals co-precipitating with zircons in each stage was estimated.The results showed that 35.24% quartz, 18.60% feldspar, 0.25% apatite, 0.14% zircon, 0.12% allanite, and 0.05% titanite fractionated in the early stage, and 67.50% quartz, 23.41% feldspar, 0.15% zircon, 0.10% allanite, 0.07% apatite, and 0.06% titanite fractionated in the second stage (Fig. 4). \n\nFig. 4 Cartoon showing the crystallization process for the high-silica melt\nThis result is generally consistent with the conclusion drawn by rhyolite MELTS, which says that the high silica melt crystallization process is essentially invariant, with almost 30 wt % crystallization in the first 1.5℃ of cooling, followed by an additional 60 wt % crystallization in the following 1.7℃ with a total of 90 wt % crystallization in slightly more than 3℃ cooling (Gualda et al., 2012). The discovery of different zircons and corresponding estimation in this study provide a new line of evidence for the fractionation of high-silica melt.\n\nFig. 5 Results of rhyolite-MELTS simulation which shows distinct nearly invariant behavior marked by co-crystallization of quartz, sanidine and plagioclase in the presence of a fluid phase from Gualda et al.

Overview of Zircon_in-situ\nZircon_in-situ is a program that calculates the percentage of co-precipitation minerals (x) with zircon whose trace element composition variation is caused by co-precipitation minerals’ crystallization in a closed system. Modeling of crystallization in Zircon_in-situ is based on the in-situ fractionation formula (Hanson and Langmuir 1978) and nonnegative least squares method (Lawson and Hanson 1974). This program runs in the MATLAB®2012a or higher vision. This program could be download in the supplemtary files in my paper on Chemical Geology.\n2. Input file\nZircon_in-situ contains three input files (.csv): (1) Parameter file. The parameters include the range of remaining melt (F) and its calculation step, and the range of mean fraction of the mixture of liquids returned from the solidification zone (f) and its calculation step. (2) Zircon trace element composition file. It includes initial and terminal zircon composition and normative zircon composition.

It is necessary and significant to find a quick way to create figures to show their geochemical variation. Because most scholars use Microsoft Excel® to process data, I design a VB program which incorporates the most common geochemical discrimination figures, trace element spider diagrams, Haker diagrams and etc. While a great deal of software could do this job, my program has two unique advantages: (1) Quickly sort element sequence (2) Automatically Group data. These two functions could significantly increase work efficiency.\nThe following is a simple introduction to these two programs.\nSort data\nThe sequence of the major and trace elements listed in tables is different from author to author, which cause much inconvenience when comparing data to each other. The quick VB program SortData.xlam is designed to solve this problem. For example, If we have two columns of sample data like CB15-1 and CB15-2 (Fig. 1), And we want the elements to be sorted as SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, FeO, MnO, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O, P2O5, Fe2O3T, FeOT, Li, Be, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, As, F, B, Sn, Cs, Rb, Mo, Cd, Sr, Zr, Nb, Sb, Ba, W, Tl, Hf, Ta, Pb, Bi, Th, U, Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, LOI. \n\nFig. 1 The results of sorting\nThe first step open a new workbook and put the data needed to be sorted in ‘Sheet1’ (Please note the first column is the name of elements). Next, press “Alt+F11” to open VBA project, select DataSort and press “Run” (Fig. 2a), and a window will come up as shown in Fig. 2b. Press ‘Check element’ button. \n\nFig. 2 (a) How to run SortData program (b) The interface of SortData\nThen, it will check the element name column A in the ‘Sheet1’. If there is something wrong, for example, if ‘Al2O3’ was mistakenly written as ‘AL2O3’, it will be highlighted with yellow shade (Fig. 3). You should correct it and run the program again. Please note that ‘Al2O3’ does not need to be written as ‘Al2O3’. \n\nFig. 3 Highlighting incorrect elements\nAfter making sure the names of elements are all correct, click ‘SortData’ button. The data will be sorted as we want (Fig. 1). You can see that the sequence of CaO and MgO has been changed and there are some Table cells like Ge, and As is blank because the original data do not have them.\nGroup data and plot\nCopy the sort data into a new workbook and open the Quickplot.xlam. Change the content of table cell A1, B1, C1, D1 into ‘Group name’, ‘Longitude and latitude’, ‘Age (Ma)’, and ‘Rock type’, respectively. If you do not know the latter three, just leave them blank, but make sure you have names for each group. For example, I divide the data into four groups: ‘OB’, ‘GB’, ‘HG’, and ‘GT’ by rock type. You just type the group name in the first column at the first appearance row of each group (Please see in Fig. 4). \n\nFig. 4 The result of grouping data\nPress “Alt+F11” to open VBA project and select ‘Quickplot’ and run. A window will come up as shown in Fig. 5. Click ‘Group’. The data will be grouped quickly (Fig. 4). And then click ‘Fe-calibration’ calibrate Fe2O3 and FeO into FeOT. \n\nFig. 5 The interface of SortData of Quickplot\nAnd then, you could click all other buttons to get other plots like TAS, A-type granite discrimination, Haker diagram, S-type granite source region discrimination, zircon saturation thermometer (ZTS), and trace element spider diagram and ect. (Fig. 6). The most striking part is that data marker is automatically set up once you confirm the group names.  \n\n\n\nFig. 6 Representative figures made by Quickplot\n"},"Personal.html":{"url":"Personal.html","title":"3 Personal","keywords":"","body":"Personal\nMy friend once asked me ‘What would you want to be if you were not a student in science?’ I answered her without hesitation:\nArtist: Chinese Calligraphy\nI studied Chinese calligraphy since I was 7 years old.
