Phase diagrams show how phases or phase assemblages change as a function of temperature, pressure, phase composition, or combinations of these variables. It provides fundamental information on the equilibrium relations among different elements and compounds. \nWhile single phase diagrams and binary phase diagrams are very useful to explain the crystallization sequence and the composition variation path of liquid and minerals, the most common igneous system in natural environment are composed of multi-components.   \nUnderstanding and interpreting these diagrams significantly relies on strong visualization skills to imagine the three dimensional (3D) shape of liquidus and solidus surfaces and their boundaries, which might be fairly complex for beginners who lack of such ability. \nHopefully, computer-aided design software offers a new, more interactive method for presenting 3D information. Here, I would share my own understanding of how to compose a 3D ternary phase diagram from scratch. I developed a series of computer-based modules to help students visualize the different phase volumes within a 3D ternary phase diagram. \nSo, Let’s roll.\n"},"Principles.html":{"url":"Principles.html","title":"Principles","keywords":"","body":"Principles\nThe basic idea of building 3D model is transforming 2D shapes into 3D objects. There are generally four basic ways: \n(1) extrude: add depth to a shape object and make it a 3D object \n(2) loft: create shape objects to serve as a path and any number of cross-sectional shapes. The path becomes the framework that holds the cross-sections forming loft object. \n(3) revolve: rotate a 2D shape about an axis \n(4) directly depict each surface of objects \nFurthermore, the four steps are required to a build ternary phase diagram: \n(1)    Determine the number of phase regions\n(2)    Determine the boundaries between these two adjacent phase regions. There are three possible types of boundary: point contact, line contact and surface contact.\n(3)    Build model by following the four basic approaches discussed above\n(4)    Check models through isothermal sections\nThe software here we used is AUTOCAD 2018® and 3DS MAX® both of which are produced by AUTODESK® company.\n\nIn next part, we will use three important and characteristic cases to illustrate the process of building a 3D ternary phase diagram.\n"},"Ternary Eutectic System No Solid Solubility.html":{"url":"Ternary Eutectic System No Solid Solubility.html","title":"Ternary Eutectic System (No Solid Solubility)","keywords":"","body":"Ternary eutectic system (no solid solubility)\nThis phase diagram means that a liquid phase solidifies into three separate solid phases, all of which exhibit no solid solubility (Fig. 2). \n\nFig. 2 the 2D shape of ternary eutectic system (no solid solubility)\nIt has four phase regions (a) Homogeneous liquid phase: L (b) Liquid + one solid phase: L+A, L+B, L+C (c) Liquid + two solid phases: L+A+B, L+A+C, L+B+C (d) Three solid phases: A+B+C.

Understanding the formation of high-silica granite is important, because it is an important carrier of incompatible elements and commonly associated with rhyolite eruption. A large number of scholars believed that most high-silica granites were extracted from an intermediate magma chambers into the shallow crust via the liquid-crystal segregation process (as shown in Fig. 1 Bachmann and Bergantz, 2004). However, whether high-silica melt could undergo significant fractionation after the segregation remains unclear. \n\nFig. 1 Schematic illustration of the melt expulsion model for the generation of crystal-poor rhyolites from Bachmann and Bergantz (2004)\nA few scholars considered high-silica melt is difficult to further fractionate due to its high viscosity (Pitcher, 1997; Petford, 2003; Glazner, 2014). And some scholars believe that the extreme fractionation of feldspar and biotite could lead to unrealistic high SiO2 content. On the contrary, others argued that dissolved water in high-silica melts reduces the viscosity and makes significant fractionation possible (Lee et al., 2015). Moreover, crystallization process of high silica melt does not follow traditional Rayleigh fractionation formula but in-situ fractionation model (Langmuir, 1989, Fig. 2). Thus, the quartz could be segregated from the melt and reduce the SiO2 content.\n\nFig. 2 Schematic diagram of in situ crystallization\nIn our study, we contribute to this topic through the lens of zircon trace element variation. Zircon is a robust proxy for magma fractionation (Claiborne et al., 2010). Considering the fact of that REE in zircon are significantly influenced by different co-precipitating minerals, the types and amounts of the co-precipitating minerals can be calculated via the fractionation principle in terms of REE variation of zircon (Hoskin et al., 2000; Loader et al., 2017).\nThe zircons crystallized from our granite samples can be divided into two groups. The group 1 zircons are characterized by lower Hf ( 12,200 ppm), and display elevated U values (936–2429 ppm, averaging 1557 ppm) and Yb values (755–1556 ppm, averaging 1134 ppm), as well as lower EuN/Eu^N (0.01–0.1) (Fig. 3). \n\nFig. 3 Two types of zircon with different geochemical composition\nThe presence of these two groups of zircons is considered to reflect two-stage in-situ fractionation processes, which display distinct REE (rare earth elements) compositions in the magma system in response to differing precipitated mineral assemblages. In light of the change of zircon REE within each group, the percentage of minerals co-precipitating with zircons in each stage was estimated. The results showed that 35.24% quartz, 18.60% feldspar, 0.25% apatite, 0.14% zircon, 0.12% allanite, and 0.05% titanite fractionated in the early stage, and 67.50% quartz, 23.41% feldspar, 0.15% zircon, 0.10% allanite, 0.07% apatite, and 0.06% titanite fractionated in the second stage (Fig. 4). \n\nFig. 4 Cartoon showing the crystallization process for the high-silica melt\nThis result is generally consistent with the conclusion drawn by rhyolite MELTS, which says that the high silica melt crystallization process is essentially invariant, with almost 30 wt % crystallization in the first 1.5℃ of cooling, followed by an additional 60 wt % crystallization in the following 1.7℃ with a total of 90 wt % crystallization in slightly more than 3℃ cooling (Gualda et al., 2012). The discovery of different zircons and corresponding estimation in this study provide a new line of evidence for the fractionation of high-silica melt.\n\nFig. 5 Results of rhyolite-MELTS simulation which shows distinct nearly invariant behavior marked by co-crystallization of quartz, sanidine and plagioclase in the presence of a fluid phase from Gualda et al.

Overview of Zircon_in-situ\nZircon_in-situ is a program that calculates the percentage of co-precipitation minerals (x) with zircon whose trace element composition variation is caused by co-precipitation minerals’ crystallization in a closed system. Modeling of crystallization in Zircon_in-situ is based on the in-situ fractionation formula (Hanson and Langmuir 1978) and nonnegative least squares method (Lawson and Hanson 1974). This program runs in the MATLAB®2012a or higher vision. This program could be download in the supplemtary files in my paper on [Chemical Geology].(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0009254118303814)\n2. Input file\nZircon_in-situ contains three input files (.csv): (1) Parameter file. The parameters include the range of remaining melt (F) and its calculation step, and the range of mean fraction of the mixture of liquids returned from the solidification zone (f) and its calculation step. (2) Zircon trace element composition file. It includes initial and terminal zircon composition and normative zircon composition. (3) Partition coefficients file.\n2.1    Parameter file\nA typical parameter file is shown in the Fig.S1. It displays the initial and terminal point and calculation step of (F) and (f).\n\nFigure S1 Parameter file \n2.2    Zircon trace element composition file\nThe zircon trace element composition file consists of a 5\\times (m+1) matrix (Fig. S2), where m is the number of trace elements involved in calculation. The first row is the names of elements. The second row is the initial composition of zircon, and the third row is the terminal composition of zircon. The fourth row is normative zircon composition. The purpose of setting normative zircon composition is to normalize the trace element composition of samples to standout the compositional variation among samples.\n\nFig. S2 Zircon trace element composition file\n2.3    Partition coefficients file\nThe partition coefficients file consists of a (n+1)\\times(m+1) matrix, where m is the number of trace element and n is the number of minerals involved calculation. In the matrix, the first row is the name of each trace element. And the first column is the name of each mineral. Note that the partition coefficients of zircon must be put in the second row. (Fig. S3).\n\nFig. S3 Partition coefficients file\n3. How to run Zircon_in-situ\nAfter preparing all input files for running, open the MATLAB®, make sure the main program (Zircon_in_situ.m) and the three input files should be put in the same work path. Then select the Zircon_in_situ.m file and click right mouth button to run (Fig. S4).\n\nFig. S4 Operation interface of Zircon_in_situ\n4.

It is necessary and significant to find a quick way to create figures to show their geochemical variation. Because most scholars use Microsoft Excel® to process data, I design a VB program which incorporates the most common geochemical discrimination figures, trace element spider diagrams, Haker diagrams and etc. While a great deal of software could do this job, my program has two unique advantages: (1) Quickly sort element sequence (2) Automatically Group data. These two functions could significantly increase work efficiency.\nThe next part will show how to run this program.\nLet’s roll\nSort data\nThe sequence of the major and trace elements listed in tables is different from author to author, which cause much inconvenience when comparing data to literature. The smart VB program (SortData.xlam) is designed to solve this problem. For example, If we have two columns of sample data like CB15-1 and CB15-2 (Fig. 1), And we want the elements to be set as SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, FeO, MnO, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O, P2O5, Fe2O3T, FeOT, Li, Be, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, As, F, B, Sn, Cs, Rb, Mo, Cd, Sr, Zr, Nb, Sb, Ba, W, Tl, Hf, Ta, Pb, Bi, Th, U, Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, LOI. \n\nFig. 1 The results of sorting\nThe first step open a new workbook and put the data needed to be sorted in ‘Sheet1’ (Please note the first column is the name of elements). Next, press “Alt+F11” to open VBAproject, select DataSort and press “Run” (Fig. 2a), and a window will come up as shown in Fig. 2b. Press ‘Check element’ button. \n\nFig. 2 (a) How to run SortData program (b) The interface of SortData\nThen, it will check the element name column A in the ‘Sheet1’. If there is something wrong, for example, if ‘Al2O3’ was mistakenly written as ‘AL2O3’, it will be highlighted with yellow shade (Fig. 3). You should correct it and run the program again. Please note that ‘Al2O3’ does not need to be written as ‘Al2O3’. \n\nFig. 3 Highlighting incorrect elements\nAfter making sure the name of elements is all correct, click ‘SortData’ button. The data will be sorted as we want (Fig. 1). You can see that the sequence of CaO and MgO has been changed and there are some elements like Ge, and As is blank because the original data do not have them.\nGroup data and plot\nCopy the sort data into a new workbook and Open the ‘Quickplot.xlam’. The table cell A1, B1, C1, D1 is ‘Group name’, ‘Longitude and latitude’, ‘Age (Ma)’, and ‘Rock type’, respectively. If you do not know the latter three, just leave them blank, but you need to know names for each group. For example, I divide the data into four groups: ‘OB’, ‘GB’, ‘HG’, and ‘GT’ by rock type. You just type the group name in the first column of your data (Fig. 4). \n\nFig. 4 The result of grouping data\nPress “Alt+F11” to open VBAproject and select ‘Quickplot’ and run. a window will come up as shown in Fig. 5. Click ‘Group’. The data will be grouped quickly (Fig. 4). And then click ‘Fe-calibration’ calibrate Fe2O3 and FeO into FeOT. \n\nFig. 5 The interface of SortData of Quickplot\nAnd then, you could click all other buttons to get other plots like TAS, A-type granite discrimination, Haker diagram, S-type granite source region discrimination, zircon saturation thermometer (ZTS), and trace element spider diagram and ect (Fig. 6). \n\n\n\nFig. 6 Representative figures made by Quickplot\n"},"Personal.html":{"url":"Personal.html","title":"Personal","keywords":"","body":"Personal\nMy friend once asked me ‘What would you want to be if you were not a student in science?’ I answer her without hesitation:\nArtists: Chinese Calligraphy\nI studied Chinese calligraphy since I was 7 years old.
