# Personal
My friend once asked me ‘What would you want to be if you were not a student in science?’ I answer her without hesitation:

##Artists: Chinese Calligraphy
I studied Chinese calligraphy since I was 7 years old. It is a form of aesthetical and artistic expression of human language in a tangible form. I has over 2,000 years history. This type of expression has been widely practiced in China and has been generally held in high esteem across East Asia. Calligraphy provides me a window to travel through space and time and ‘communicate’ with Chinese ancestors: feel their emotions and understand why and how they write this masterpiece.

##Musician: Jazz and blues music
I studied blues harmonica for two years by myself. Here is the demo of my recording of [Amazing Grace](https://github.com/qiweizh/Qiweizh.github.io/blob/master/research/Amazing%20Grace.mp4).

My most favorite Jazz singer is Norah Jones who developed a unique blend of jazz and traditional vocal pop, with hints of bluesy country and country folk. Her elegant and sensuous voice make people feel soothing and peaceful.
