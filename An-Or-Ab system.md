# An-Ab-Or system

The binary phase diagram between An and Ab is a continuous solid solution system, between An and Or is eutectic system and between Ab and Or is exsolution system (Fig. 10).

Fig. 10 the 2D shape of An-Ab-Or system

When they form a ternary phase diagram, it contains five phase regions (a) Homogeneous liquid phase: L (b) L+ plagioclase (c) one solid phase, plagioclase (with little Or), alkali feldspar (with little An) (d) miscibility gap. The boundary between (a) and (b) is liquidus surface. It has three subsurface which meet at eutectic point (Fig.11 a). Boundary between (b) and (c) is an irregular twisted surface which has a face contact with the miscibility gap (Fig. 11b). The miscibility gap is an irregular 3D object, which could be produce by the ‘loft’ as discussed before (Fig. 11c).

Fig. 11 3D model of An-Ab-Or system

After building the 3D phase diagram, the isothermal sections were performed. They shows a continuous change of each phase region, proving the credibility of our model.

Fig. 12 isothermal sections of An-Ab-Or system

After drawing the isothermal sections, it is easy to determine the composition and amount of each phase. For example, suppose liquid overall composition is X, with the temperature lowering, the liquid first begin to crystallize An rich feldspar P, and the fraction of liquid is PX/PQ, the fraction of solid B is XQ/PQ govern by Inverse Lever Rule (Fig. 13a). As the temperature continues lowering, feldspar begin to divided into two phases. The point P, J, Q construct phase triangle, and the fraction of feldspar P is XN/PN, the fraction of feldspar Q is KX/KQ, the fraction of liquid is MX/MJ.
