# Introduction
Welcome to my personal academic site. My name is Qiwei. I'm a graduate student in China University of Geosciences (Beijing). My research orientation is quantitative petrology. I will be using this site to post my research about ternary phase diagram, the fractionation process of high silica granite and the computer programs I made. Here is my [CV](https://github.com/qiweizh/Qiweizh.github.io/blob/master/research/CV_Qiwei.pdf). If any questions come up, please don't hesitate to contact me through my email:qiwei.zh@foxmail.com.
