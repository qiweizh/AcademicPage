# Principles
The basic idea of building 3D model is transforming 2D shapes into 3D objects. There are generally four basic ways: 
(1) extrude: add depth to a shape object and make it a 3D object 
(2) loft: create shape objects to serve as a path and any number of cross-sectional shapes. The path becomes the framework that holds the cross-sections forming loft object. 
(3) revolve: rotate a 2D shape about an axis 
(4) directly depict each surface of objects 

Furthermore, the four steps are required to a build ternary phase diagram: 
(1)	Determine the number of phase regions
(2)	Determine the boundaries between these two adjacent phase regions. There are three possible types of boundary: point contact, line contact and surface contact.
(3)	Build model by following the four basic approaches discussed above
(4)	Check models through isothermal sections
The software here we used is AUTOCAD 2018® and 3DS MAX® both of which are produced by AUTODESK® company.

In next part, we will use three important and characteristic cases to illustrate the process of building a 3D ternary phase diagram.
