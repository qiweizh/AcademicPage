# Ternary eutectic system (no solid solubility)

This phase diagram means that a liquid phase solidifies into three separate solid phases, all of which exhibit no solid solubility (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2 the 2D shape of ternary eutectic system (no solid solubility)


It has four phase regions (a) Homogeneous liquid phase: L (b) Liquid + one solid phase: L+A, L+B, L+C (c) Liquid + two solid phases: L+A+B, L+A+C, L+B+C (d) Three solid phases: A+B+C. The boundary between (a) and (b) is liquidus surface. It has three sub surfaces and they meet at eutectic point (Fig. 3a). This surface can be directly depicted through the NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines), which are a technique for interactively modeling 3D curves and surfaces. The boundary between (c) and (d) is solidus surface, which is a triangle parallel to the bottom triangle (Fig. 3c). The eutectic point is just at this surface. The boundary between (b) and (c) is a little bit complex. It consists of six twisted surfaces and the intersection line of them meet with that of three sub surfaces of liquidus surface (Fig. 3b).

Fig. 3 3D model of ternary eutectic system (no solid solubility)

After building the 3D phase diagram, the isothermal sections were performed. They show a continuous change of each phase region (Fig. 4), proving the credibility of our model.

Fig. 4 isothermal sections of ternary eutectic system (no solid solubility)

After drawing the isothermal sections, it is easy to determine the composition and amount of each phase. For example, suppose liquid overall composition is X, with the temperature lowering, the liquid first begin to crystallize solid B, and the fraction of liquid is BX/BY, the fraction of solid B is XY/BY govern by Inverse Lever Rule (Fig. 5a). As the temperature continues lowering, solid B and C begin to co-precipitate. The point Q, B, C construct phase triangle, and the fraction of solid B is XN/BN, the fraction of solid C is MX/MC, the fraction of liquid is XP/QP (Fig. 5b).
